  <title>Group Homomorphisms</title><!--Chapter 15-->

  <objectives>
    <title>The learning outcomes for this chapter are to...</title>
    <ul><li>...understand the definition of group homomorphisms and isomorphisms.</li>
	    <li>...be able to give several (non)-examples of homomorphisms and isomorphisms.</li></ul>
  </objectives>
  
  <p>
     Just like ring homomorphisms were the "useful" maps between rings, group homomorphisms can be viewed as the "useful" maps between groups. 
     Recall also that the "useful" ring maps were ones that preserved the operations. 
     Here's the main definition of this chapter:
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-GroupHom">
    <title>Group Homomorophisms</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>G</m> and <m>H</m> be groups, with operations <m>\star_G</m> and <m>\star_H</m> respectively. 
        A function <m>\varphi:G\to H</m> is called a <term>group homomorphism</term> (or simply homomorphism when it's clear we're discussing groups) if for every <m>g_1,g_2\in G</m>, <md>\varphi(g_1\star_G g_2)=\varphi(g_1)\star_H\varphi(g_2)</md>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <example>
    <title>A "Natural" Surjection</title>
    <p>Let <m>G=\Z</m> and <m>H=\Z/2\Z</m>. 
      The function <m>\varphi:\Z\to\Z/2\Z</m> given by <m>n\mapsto [n]</m> is a surjective group homomorphism. 
      Indeed, <md>\varphi(n+m)=[n+m]=[n]+[m]=\varphi(n)+\varphi(m)</md>.
    </p>
  </example>

  <example xml:id="eg-GroupNatSurj">
    <title>Generalizing our "Natural" Surjection</title>
    <p>
      More generally, there is a surjective group homomorphism <m>G\to G/N</m> for any group <m>G</m> and normal subgroup <m>N</m> of <m>G</m> given by <m>\varphi(g)=gN</m>. (Possibly) you should prove this!?
    </p>
  </example>

  <example xml:id="eg-GroupNatInj">
    <title>A "Natural" Injection</title>
    <p>
      Also, for any group <m>G</m> and subgroup <m>H\subseteq G</m>, the "natural" inclusion map:
      <md>\iota:H\to G\qquad\text{given by}\qquad h\mapsto h</md>
      is an injective group homomorphism.
    </p>
  </example>

  <example>
    <title>A Non-Example</title>
    <p>
      The map <m>\varphi:S_3\to S_3</m> given by <m>\sigma\mapsto(12)\sigma</m> is not a group homomorphism. Why not?
    </p>
  </example>

  <p>
    Take a look back at Definition 8.7<!--Need a new reference soon!!!--> if you need reminders about the words injective, surjective, and/or bijective.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-GroupIsom">
    <title>Group Isomorphisms</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>G</m> and <m>H</m> be groups. 
        A function <m>\varphi:G\to H</m> is called a <term>group isomorphism</term> (or simply isomorphism when it is clear we're discussing groups) if <m>\varphi</m> is a bijective homomorphism. 
        When such an isomorphism exists, we say that <m>G</m> and <m>H</m> are <term>isomorphic</term> and denote this by <m>G\cong H</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <example>
    <title>An Isomorphism</title>
    <p>Recall that the group <m>Q_8/Z</m> from <xref ref="eg-Q8modZ"/> looked an awful lot like <m>\Z/2\Z\times\Z/2\Z</m>.
      In fact, these are isomorphic groups! 
      We can demonstrate this by comparing Cayley tables and explicitly giving the bijection; 
      however, showing the map is a homomorphism without demonstrating that the Cayley tables are just relabeled is harder to do. 
      We'll come back to this in the next chapter once we have a few more tools to prove these are isomorphic in a nicer way.

        	Complete the missing parts above. They're listed below to help you out!
           <ol>
            <li>Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>H</m> a subgroup of <m>G</m>. 
              From <xref ref="eg-GroupNatSurj"/>, show that the function <m>\varphi:G\to G/H</m> given by <m>g\mapsto gH</m> is a surjective homomorphism.
              <fn>Note that this means you must both show it is a ring homomorphism and a surjective function.</fn></li>
		        <li>Let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of a group <m>G</m> and <m>\iota</m> the function from <xref ref="eg-GroupNatInj"/>. 
              Show that this is indeed a group homomorphism.</li>
            <li> Recall that every ring is a group under addition, so when we discuss the group <m>\Z</m>, we're using only the addition operation. 
              Either prove the function <m>\varphi:\Z\to\Z</m> given by <m>n\mapsto 3n</m> is a group homomorphism, or demonstrate an explicit counterexample showing it is not a group homomorphism.</li>
          </ol>

    </exercise>
    <exercise number="15.B">
      <statement><p> Here are some (non-)examples of group homomorphisms and isomorphisms. 
      Show that each is a group homomorphism or is not a homomorphism. 
      For those that are group homomorphisms, determine whether or not they're injective or surjective (or bijective). 
      For those that are not group homomorphisms, provide an explicit counterexample to the definition of a group homomorphism. 
      Since some of these are rings, so inherently come with two operations, does it matter which operation you choose? 
      Phrased another way, is a ring also group under both operations?
      <ol><li>The function <m>\varphi:2\Z\to3\Z</m> given by <m>2n\mapsto 3n</m>.</li>
        <li>The function <m>\varphi:2\Z\to\Z</m> given by <m>2n\mapsto n</m>.</li>

                  Like the examples in problem 8.D, some of these are likely large enough groups that it is a bad ida to try and list all the functions and identify the homomorphisms from that list.
