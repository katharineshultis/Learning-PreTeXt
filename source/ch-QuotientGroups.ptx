    </objectives>

    <p>Let’s start off with working on drawing parallels between quotient rings and quotient groups. In particular, it would be good to have a better understanding of the cosets of a normal subgroup of a group and their relationship with cosets of an ideal of a ring.</p>
    <p>Recall (probably from Math 301) that equivalence relations define a partition on a set, and a partition of a set defines an equivalence relation. In ring land, we first defined an equivalence relation, and defined our cosets to be the equivalence classes that form the associated partition. Since we already have a definition of cosets for groups, perhaps we should think about things in reverse here by showing our cosets form a partition and “reverse engineering” the equivalence relation out of that.</p>

    <proposition xml:id="prop-CosetsPartition">
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>N</m> a subgroup of <m>G</m>. Then, the left cosets of <m>N</m> form a partition of <m>G</m>, i.e., <md>\displaystyle\bigcup_{g\in G}gN=G</md> and for <m>g,h\in G</m>, either <m>gN=hN</m> or <m>gN\cap hN=\emptyset</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>N</m> a subgroup of <m>G</m>. 
                As <m>gN\subseteq G</m> for every <m>g\in G</m>, then the containment <m>\displaystyle\bigcup_{g\in G}gN\subseteq G</m> holds. 
                To see that we have equality, let <m>x\in G</m> and note that since <m>e\in N</m>, we have <m>x=xe\in xN</m> so that <m>x\in \displaystyle\bigcup_{g\in G}gN</m> as well. 
                What remains then is to let <m>g,h\in G</m>, assume that <m>gN\cap hN\neq\emptyset</m> and show that <m>gN=hN</m>. 
                So let <m>x\in gN</m> and write <m>x=gn</m> for some <m>n\in N</m>. 
                Also, since <m>gN\cap hN\neq\emptyset</m>, we know there is some <m>y\in gN\cap hN</m>. 
                Write <m>y=ga=hb</m> for some <m>a,b\in N</m>. 
                Multiplying on the right by <m>a^{-1}</m> yields <m>g=hba^{-1}</m>. Thus, <m>x=gn=hba^{-1}n</m>. 
                Since <m>a,b\in N</m>, we know <m>ba^{-1}n\in N</m> and so <m>x=h(ba^{-1}n)\in hN</m>, which shows that <m>gN\subseteq hN</m>. 
                A similar argument shows that <m>hN\subseteq gN</m> so that <m>gN=hN</m> as desired. 
            </p>
        </proof>
    </proposition>
    <p>
        Now that we know the left cosets of a normal subgroup form a partition of the group, we know there is an associated equivalence relation. 
        Let's work out the details of that.
        Let <m>[x]</m> denote the set of a partition which contains the element <m>x</m>.
        The equivalence relation defined from a partition is <md>x\sim y\Longleftrightarrow [x]=[y]</md>.
        Using the notation we have for the cosets, this becomes 
        <md>
            <mrow>g\sim h \amp\Longleftrightarrow gN=hN</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp\Longleftrightarrow g\in hN</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp\Longleftrightarrow \text{ there exists an }n\in N\text{ such that }g=hn\</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp\Longleftrightarrow \text{ there exists an }n\in N\text{ such that }h^{-1}g=n</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp\Longleftrightarrow h^{-1}g\in N</mrow>
        </md>
        and so our equivalence relation boils down to being <md>g\sim h\Longleftrightarrow h^{-1}g\in N</md>
        which, we might have guessed based on the equivalence relation for ideals.

    <theorem xml:id="thm-QuotientGroupsareGroups">
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be a group, <m>N</m> a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>, and define an operation <m>\ast</m> on the left cosets of <m>N</m> via <m>(gN)\ast(hN)=(gh)N</m>.
                With this operation, the set of left cosets is a group, denoted <m>G/N</m> and pronounced "G mod N."
            </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
                I'm going to leave this whole proof to you. 
                Make sure you show all of the necessary parts: the claimed operation is well-defined, the operation is associative, the operation has an identity element, and every element has an inverse.
                Don't forget that the set on which this operation is defined is the set of left cosets: <m>G/N=\{gN\mid g\in G\}</m>.
            </p>

                Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>N</m> a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>. 
                Then the group <m>G/N</m> is called a <term>quotient group</term> of <m>G</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
        <p> 
            Consider the group <m>Q_8</m> and the normal subgroup <m>\{1,-1\}</m> of <m>Q_8</m>, which we'll denote <m>Z</m>. 
            We should figure out if <m>Q_8/Z</m> is a group we've seen before by computing its elements and a Cayley table for the group.
            We'll fill in this table during class and create the Cayley table. Afterwards, I'll update these notes with the answer(s). 
            We'll know we've got all the cosets when every element of the group is in a coset. We will ensure we only have one representative of each coset by only listing each element once.

                    Here are some basics of quotient groups. Each problem has its own directions.
                    <ol marker="(i)">
                        <li>(Bonus!) As with rings, if <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> and is not a normal subgroup, things can go terribly wrong.
                            Identify a non-normal subgroup of <m>S_4</m> which I'll call <m>H</m>. 
                            Then identify an element <m>\sigma\in S_4</m> such that <m>\sigma H\neq H\sigma</m>. 
                            Conclude that the operation on the quotient of <m>S_4</m> by the non-normal subgroup you've identified is not well-defined by demonstrating an explicit example.
                            For which elements <m>\sigma</m> of <m>S_4</m> is it the case that <m>\sigma H=H\sigma</m>?

                        <li> The <term>center</term> of a group <m>G</m> is the subgroup <m>Z(G)=\{g\in G\mid gh=hg\text{ for all }h\in G\}</m>.
                            This notation comes from the word "zentrum" which is Gemran for center.
                            Prove that for any group <m>G</m>, we have <m>Z(G)</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>, so that <m>G/Z(G)</m> is always a group.

                            i.e. the largest subgroup of <m>G</m> containing <m>H</m> in which <m>H</m> is normal.
