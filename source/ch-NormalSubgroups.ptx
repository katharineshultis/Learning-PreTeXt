  <title>Normal Subgroups</title><!--Chapter 13-->

    <objectives>
    <title>The learning outcomes in this chapter are to:</title>
      <ul><li>...understand the definition of a normal subgroup.</li>
      <li>...be able to give several examples of normal subgroups.</li>
      <li>...understand some important properties of normal subgroups.</li></ul>
    </objectives>
    
    <p>Recall that with rings, the definition of an ideal was ideally suited to define quotient rings and have the resulting operations be well-defined. The notion of a normal subgroup is analogous in the sense that we want something ideally suited to define a quotient group and have the operation be well-defined.</p>
    <p>Let's think backwards a bit, and work with a group written additively. If <m>G</m> is a group, and <m>N</m> is a "normal" subgroup of <m>G</m>, we might want to define the "cosets" of <m>N</m>, i.e. the elements of the quotient group <m>G/N</m>, to be of the form <m>[g]=g+N=\{g+n\mid n\in N\}</m> with <m>g\in G</m>. Suppose further that we want the operation on these to be given by <m>[g]+[h]=[g+h]</m> for <m>[g],[h]\in G/N</m>. For this to be well-defined, we'd need that for <m>[g]=[g']</m> and <m>[h]=[h']</m>, then <m>[g+h]=[g'+h']</m>, i.e., we'd need that <m>-(g'+h')+(g+h)\in N</m> whenever <m>-g'+g\in N</m> and <m>-h'+h\in N</m>. Because we might be more prone to assuming commutativity in additive notation, and we should be careful about not assuming things we're not given, let's switch now to multiplicative notation!</p>
    
    <p>If <m>G</m> is a group written multiplicatively, with identity element <m>e</m>, and <m>N</m> is a "normal" subgroup of <m>G</m>, we have "cosets" of <m>N</m> being of the form <m>\overline{g}=[g]=gN=\{gn\mid n\in N\}</m>. For the operation <m>(gN)(hN)=(gh)N</m> to be well-defined, we will need to take <m>a,a',b,b'\in G</m> such that <m>a'N=aN</m> and <m>b'N=bN</m> and need to show that <m>(a'b')N=(ab)N</m>, i.e. that <m>(ab)^{-1}(a'b')\in N</m>. Being a bit more specific, note that <m>nN=eN</m> for any <m>n\in N</m>, and fix some <m>g\in G</m> and <m>n\in N</m>. For the operation to be well-defined in this specific instance, we'll need that <m>(nN)(gN)=(eN)(gN)</m>, i.e. we need that <m>(eg)^{-1}(ng)\in N</m>. Recall from Exercise 11.C.i that <m>(ab)^{-1}=b^{-1}a^{-1}</m> for any <m>a,b\in G</m>. Also, note that the identity element is always its own inverse. Now, note that for the operation to be well-defined, we need that <m>(eg)^{-1}(ng)=(g^{-1}e^{-1})(ng)=g^{-1}eng=g^{-1}ng</m> is an element of <m>N</m>. We're ready for the definition of a normal subgroup now, as we'll create that definition to make this work.</p>

      <title>Normal Subgroup</title>
      <statement><p>Let <m>(G,\star)</m> be a group and <m>N</m> a subset of <m>G</m>. We say that <m>N</m> is a <term>normal subgroup of <m>G</m></term>, and denote this as <m>N\lhd G</m>, if <m>N</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> and for every <m>g\in G</m> and <m>n\in N</m>, we have that <m>g^{-1}\star n\star g\in N</m> as well.</p></statement>

    <example>
      <title>Subgroups of "our" Favorite Abelian Group</title>
      	<p>Our favorite abelian group might be <m>{\mathbb{Z}}</m>, and our favorite subgroup of this is probably <m>n{\mathbb{Z}}</m> where <m>n</m> is our favorite nonzero integer. As <m>{\mathbb{Z}}</m> uses additive notation, for <m>n\in{\mathbb{Z}}</m> to be a normal subgroup of <m>{\mathbb{Z}}</m>, we'd need that <m>-g+nh+g\in n{\mathbb{Z}}</m> whenever <m>nh\in n{\mathbb{Z}}</m> and <m>g\in{\mathbb{Z}}</m>. This is "easily" seen to work, as the commutativity of the operation allows for us to rewrite this as <m>(-g+g)+nh=nh\in n{\mathbb{Z}}</m>.</p>

      <p>The example above seems to imply that every subgroup of an abelian group is normal. We should probably prove that!</p></statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>Since every subgroup of an abelian group is normal, we should really look at a non-abelian example too:</p>

      <p>Our smallest non-abelian group is <m>S_3</m>. Consider the set <m>A_3=\{(1),(1\;2\;3),(1\;3\;2)\}\subset S_3</m>. We can see, although you should ask yourself how, from this smaller part of the group table for <m>S_3</m> that <m>A_3</m> is a subgroup of <m>S_3</m>:</p>

      <p>To check that it is normal, we need that <m>g^{-1}ng\in A_3</m> for every <m>n\in A_3</m> and every <m>g\in S_3</m>. Note that it is clear that <m>g^{-1}ng\in A_3</m> if <m>g,n\in A_3</m>, so we really only need to test this for <m>g\in S_3\setminus A_3</m>. You should do these computations to get more comfortable with cycle notation for elements of a permutation group.</p>
    </example>
    <p>Let <m>G</m> be a group written multiplicatively and <m>H</m> a subgroup of <m>G</m>. Recall that the <term>left cosets</term> of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> are the sets of the form <m>gH=\{gh\mid h\in H\}</m>. We can similarly define the <term>right cosets</term> of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> to be the sets of the form <m>Hg=\{hg\mid h\in H\}</m>.</p>
    <theorem xml:id="theorem-normal-subgroup-equivalences">
      <title>Normal Subgroup Equivalent Statements</title>
      <p>Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>H</m> a subgroup of <m>G</m>. The following are equivalent:
      <ol><li label="(a)">The subgroup <m>H</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>.</li>
      <li>For every <m>g\in G</m>, we have <m>gH=Hg</m>. Note that this is a claim about set equality.</li>
      <li>For every <m>g\in G</m>, we have <m>g^{-1}Hg=H</m> where <m>g^{-1}Hg</m> denotes the set of all elements of the form <m>g^{-1}hg</m> with <m>h\in H</m>. Note that the claim <m>g^{-1}Hg=H</m> is also a claim about set equality.</li></ol></p>
    </theorem>

    <p>The equivalence of the first two items above is typically phrased to say that <em>"A subgroup <m>H</m> is normal if and only if its left and right cosets are the same."</em></p>
    
    <p>Recall that when <m>G</m> is a finite group, <m>|G|</m> is the <term>order</term> of the group <m>G</m> and defined to be the number of elements of <m>G</m>. Also, recall from Exercise 12.C that if <m>G</m> is a finite group and <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>, then the order of <m>H</m> divides the order of <m>G</m>. </p>

      <title>Index of a Subgroup</title>
      <statement><p>Let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of a finite group <m>G</m>. We call the quotient <m>\dfrac{|G|}{|H|}</m> the <term>index of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m></term> and denote it by <m>[G:H]</m>.</p></statement>

    <theorem>
      <title>Index 2 Subgroups</title>
      <statement><p>Let <m>G</m> be a finite group. If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> of index <m>2</m>, then <m>H</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>.
      </p></statement>
      <proof>	<p>I'd like for "us" to prove this. However, maybe we'll delay on a complete proof for now. Here's a sketch to get you started. Of course, we need to assume that <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> and that <m>H</m> has index <m>2</m>. Our goal/task is to show that <m>H</m> is normal, which, by <xref ref="theorem-normal-abelian-subgroups"/>, we can do by proving <m>gH=Hg</m> for every <m>g\in G</m>. So let <m>g\in G</m>. There are two possibilities:
      <ul><li>If <m>g\in H</m>, then <m>gH=H=Hg</m> as <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.</li>
      <li>if <m>g\notin H</m>, then <m>gH\cap H=\emptyset</m> and <m>Hg\cap H=\emptyset</m>. As <m>H</m> has index <m>2</m> in <m>G</m>, then <m>H</m> is half of the elements of <m>G</m> and the other half must be both <m>Hg</m> and <m>gH</m> so that <m>gH=Hg</m> as desired.</li></ul></p>
