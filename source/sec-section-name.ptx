        <statement><p> Complete the missing parts above. They're listed below to help you out! 
          <ol marker="(i)">
          <li> Explain as briefly as possible by <m>\{e\}</m> and <m>G</m> are subgroups of a group <m>G</m>.</li>
          <li> Complete the proof of <xref ref="theorem-subgroup"/>. In particular, you must show that in the backwards direction, we have that associativity holds, that the set <m>H</m> has an identity element, and that every element has an inverse in <m>H</m>.</li>
          <li> Succinctly answer the questions in <xref ref="example-rings-as-subgroups"/>.</li>
         <li> Prove the claim in <xref ref="example-subgroups-of-sn"/>. That is, prove that <m>S_n</m> is a subgroup of <m>S_m</m> when <m>n,m\in{\mathbb{N}}</m> with <m>n\leq m</m>.</li>

        <statement><p> Here are some basics of groups. Each problem has its own directions.
          <ol marker="(i)">
          <li> Let <m>IM_2({\mathbb{R}})</m> denote the set of invertible <m>2\times 2</m> matrices with entries in <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m>. Recall from Linear Algebra that this is the set <m>\{A\in M_2({\mathbb{R}})\mid \det(A)\neq 0\}</m>. Recall from Exercise 11.B(i) that <m>IM_2({\mathbb{R}})</m> is a group under matrix multiplication. Find at least three subgroups of this group, and three subsets which are not subgroups and justify your answers.</li>
          <li> Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>g_1,\ldots,g_n\in G</m>. The <term>subgroup of <m>G</m> generated by <m>g_1,\ldots,g_n</m></term> is defined as the smallest subgroup of <m>G</m> which contains <m>\{g_1,\ldots,g_n\}</m>. What is the subgroup of <m>S_4</m> generated by <m>(12)(34)</m>? What about the subgroup generated by <m>(12)</m> and <m>(34)</m>? What about the subgroup generated by <m>(123)</m> and <m>(12)(34)</m>?

        <statement><p>
          Prove Lagrange's Theorem for finite groups, which states that if <m>G</m> is a (finite) group, and <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>, then the order of <m>H</m> divides the order of <m>G</m>.
        </p></statement>
        <hint>
          <p>One way to approach this involves definite cosets of a subgroup. To that end, let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>H</m> a subgroup of <m>G</m>. Define an equivalence relation, <m>\sim</m>, on <m>G</m> via <m>x\sim y</m> if and only if <m>x^{-1}y\in H</m>. We define the <term>left cosets</term> of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> to be the equivalence classes of the equivalence relation <m>\sim</m> on <m>G</m>. With this langauge, the most common way to state Lagrange's Theorem is that for any group <m>G</m> and any subgroup <m>H\leq G</m>, we have <m>|G|=[G:H]\cdot|H|</m> where <m>[G:H]</m> is the <term>index of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m></term>, defined to be the number of left (or right) cosets of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m>.

          For each statement, prove that it is true or give a counter-example to show that it is false.<ol marker="(i)">
            <li>If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> and <m>G</m> is abelian, then <m>H</m> is abelian.</li>
            <li>If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> and <m>G</m> is non-abelian, then <m>H</m> is non-abelian.</li>
            <li>If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> and <m>G</m> is finite, then <m>H</m> is finite.</li>
